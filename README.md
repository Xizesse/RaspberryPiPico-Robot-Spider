# RaspberryPiPico-Robot-Spider

This repository contains the code for a 4-legged robotic spider carried out as part of the Course Unit Embedded Computer Architecture (Arquitetura de Computação Embarcada) in FEUP. The project includes a Time-of-Flight sensor, an IMU, and 8 SG90 servo motors, to create a functional robotic spider capable of performing tasks like obstacle avoidance and movement on varying terrains.
